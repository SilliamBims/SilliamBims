- 👋 Hi, I’m a human creature whose biological agency may find occasional fits of expression on GitHub, through @SilliamBims

- 👀 I’m interested in the ability of technology to integrate more sustainably with our planet's ecological discursiveness, including our human bodies.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about IPFS/IPLD/CID and ways traditionally centralized platforms may be adapted, or reinvented for distributed networks.

- 💞️ I’m looking to build a collaborative network for creating wiki-like software for the distributed web.

- 📫 How to reach me ... my github handle at protonmail.com
